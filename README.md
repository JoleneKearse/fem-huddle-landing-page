## Overview 🔎

### The Challenge 🏁

Users should be able to:
- [x] View the optimal layout for the page depending on their device's screen size
- [x] See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot 📸

Here's the provided design files:

And, tada 🪄, my solution - also in desktop, active states and mobile views:

- [Github](https://github.com/JoleneKearse/fem-huddle-landing-page#overview-) - I certainly hope you're checking out this awesome-sauce README that I spent a fun evening composing!
- [Live link]() - And also hope you, spectacular 🌟 you, have the time to impart your so-appreciated code reviews to me.  

## My Process 🤔

I generally always start out **mobile-first**, but I had recently caught an article on whether mobile-first should be your choice.  So, I considered the use case of this particular website...
- I could see a product manager going into a company boardroom and doing an awesome lead-through of the product...
- ... but then thought, hmm... most users would come from emails or calls to action from elsewhere, so...
- The majority would probably still see it from their mobiles! 

So mobile-first won out! 🎆

Next I decided, semi-with-crossed-fingers 🤞, that the 'cross the diamond' images in the back would be do-able with psuedo-elements and decided to leave that until the end.  _I'm hoping that doesn't come back to bite me in the butt!_ ⚡

### Built with 🛠
- Semantic HTML5 markup - _I'd forgotten this on my last challenge, which I blame React for. !_ 🤣
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned 📜

1) I do not know as much about applying `:hover` and `:focus` effects to **svg** images as I thought!

## Author 🤪
<hr>

Hiya! 👋 My name is **Jolene Kearse**, (no pronouns, as Jolene, or pretty much whatever you want to call me - within limits 🤣 - is fine with me).  

I may be a _tad_ older than you at 41 👊, simply because I was an **English as a Foreign Language Teacher** ️🌏🧑‍🏫 for over 15 years - so, yeah, _for a little bit_ 🤌...  I lived all over the world, including China, England & South Korea.

But that was then! 

...

Now I'm an awesome **Software Engineer**! :dancer:  I'm a **proud, self-taught individual**. 

### My journey 📆

I'm also proud of how far I came in 2022.  I finally learned **JavaScript**! 🍻 _I had struggled for about a year before I finally could add that to my skillset.  If you're interested in an awesome 🔥 course check out **[Class Central's Bootcamp YouTube Playlist going through freeCodeCamp's Algorithms and Data Structures Certification](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLU3RKvMpgrSEoqVIV14K_zuinrIBcnCgT)._

Then I met an awesome group of fellow-learning devs, **The Explorers**.  This exposed me to the myriad and oft-confusing ways of using **Git** in a team - loving it now!  But also projects using so many kinds of tech that would've just blown my mind a year before 🤯 including:
- React
- TypeScript
- Tailwind

I even participated in **[#Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com/)** and earned the coveted T-shirt! 🎉👕

But who cares about 2022? This is 2023!

...

I've been boning up on **React**, and just taking so many courses to learn **Backend Development** and **navigate the process of earning my first tech job**!

One of those courses has seen me going back to **Python** - which I had treated as my _crutch language_ to understand JavaScript.  🤣  But I've been loving navigating in multiple languages.

Another challenge I am undertaking this year is [Exercism's](https://exercism.org/) **#12in23**.  This is a cool 😎 opportunity to _try out_ 12 different languages this year.  Each month has a theme, like **Functional February** and **Mechanical March** to encourage you to check out different language paradims.  I'm loving this chance to dip my toe in other types of programming.  I find I'm gaining the ability to evaluate various language's strengths and project needs.
