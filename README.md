# Frontend Mentor Challenge - Huddle Landing Page Solution

I decided to focus on being **mobile-first**, **responsive** & **accessible** for the **[Huddle Landing Page Challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/huddle-landing-page-with-a-single-introductory-section-B_2Wvxgi0/hub)**.

Hiya! 👋 My name is **Jolene Kearse**, (no pronouns, as Jolene, or pretty much whatever you want to call me - within limits 🤣 - is fine with me).  I may be a _tad_ older than you at 41 👊, simply because I was an **English as a Foreign Language Teacher** 🧑‍🏫 for over 15 years - so, yeah, for a little bit 🤌...  I lived all over the world, including China, England & South Korea.

But that was then! 

Now I'm an awesome **Software Engineer**! :dancer:  I'm a **proud, self-taught individual**. 

I'd love ❤️ to connect with y'all (_sorry, I love using that ironicallly and do so with great frequency_ 😜):
