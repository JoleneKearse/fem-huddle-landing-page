# Frontend Mentor Challenge - Huddle Landing Page Solution 🎭

I decided to focus on being **mobile-first**, **responsive** & **accessible** for the **[Huddle Landing Page Challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/huddle-landing-page-with-a-single-introductory-section-B_2Wvxgi0/hub)**.

<hr>

Hiya! 👋 My name is **Jolene Kearse**, (no pronouns, as Jolene, or pretty much whatever you want to call me - within limits 🤣 - is fine with me).  I may be a _tad_ older than you at 41 👊, simply because I was an **English as a Foreign Language Teacher** ️🌏🧑‍🏫 for over 15 years - so, yeah, for a little bit 🤌...  I lived all over the world, including China, England & South Korea.

But that was then! 

Now I'm an awesome **Software Engineer**! :dancer:  I'm a **proud, self-taught individual**. 

### My journey 📆

I'm also proud of how far I came in 2022.  I finally learned **JavaScript**! 🍻 _I had struggled for about a year before I finally could add that to my skillset.  If you're interested in an awesome 🔥 course check out **[Class Central's Bootcamp YouTube Playlist going through freeCodeCamp's Algorithms and Data Structures Certification](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLU3RKvMpgrSEoqVIV14K_zuinrIBcnCgT)._

Then I met an awesome group of fellow learning devs, **The Explorers**.  This exposed me to the myriad and oft-confusing ways of using **Git** in a team - loving it now!  But also projects using so many kinds of tech that would've just blown my mind a year before 🤯 including:
- React
- TypeScript
- Tailwind

I even participated in **[#Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com/)** and earned the T-shirt! 🎉👕

But who cares about 2022? This is 2023!

I've been boning up on **React**, and just taking so many courses to learn **Backend Development** and **navigate the process of earning my first tech job**!
